# Project Euler
# Problem 22: Names Scores
#       Using 22-names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand
#       first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then
#       working out the alphabetical value of each name, multiply this
#       by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
#
#       For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
#       COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th
#       name on the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 * 53 = 49714.
#
#       What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
