# Project Euler
# Problem 15: Lattice Paths
#       Starting in the top left corner of a 2x2 grid, and only being able
#       to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the
#       bottom right corner.
#            * *        * _        * _
#           |_|_*      |_*_|      |_**|
#           |_|_*      |_**|      |_|_*
#           RRDD        RDDR       RDRD
#
#            _ _        _ _        _ _
#           **|*|      **|_|      *_|_|
#           |_|_*      |_**|      **|*|
#           DRRD       DRDR       DDRR
#
#       How many such routes are there through a 20x20 grid?
