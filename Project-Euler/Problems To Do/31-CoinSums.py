# Problem 31: Coin Sums
#         In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and
#         there are eight coins in general circulation:
#
#         1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).
#         It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
#
#         1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
#         How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
