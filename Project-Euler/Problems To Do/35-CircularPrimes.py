# Project Euler
# Problem 35: Circular Primes
#       The number, 197, is called a circular prime because
#       all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are
#       themselves prime.
#
#       There are thirteen such primes below 100:
#           2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.
#
#       How many circular primes are there below one million?
