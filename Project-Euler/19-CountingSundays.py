# Problem 19: Counting Sundays
#       You are given the following information, but you may prefer
#       to do some research yourself.
#           * 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
#           * Thirty days has September,
#             April, June and November.
#             All the rest have thirty-one,
#             Saving February alone,
#             which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
#             And on leap years,  twenty-nine
#           * A leap year occurs on any year divisible by 4,
#                  but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
#
#       How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the
#       twentieth Century?  (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)
